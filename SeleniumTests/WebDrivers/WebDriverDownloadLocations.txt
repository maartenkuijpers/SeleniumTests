You can download the web drivers for specific browser types here:

Chrome: "ChromeDriver.exe"
http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

Internet Explorer: "IEDriverServer.exe"
http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
--> the x64-version has a major performance issue. Recommending the x86 instead, even on 64-bit CPU.

Firefox:
I believe this is available by default when you have Firefox installed.

Safari:
(not used yet)

PhantomJS
PhantomJS is a headless browser technique that performs browsing without rendering. It supports javascript and the
document object model and can render screenshots. The webdriver 'phantomjs.exe' is a larger WebDriver because this
contains both the Browser itself and the driver.
